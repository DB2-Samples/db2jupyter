    "## Autocommit and Commit Scope\n",
    "By default, any SQL statements executed with the `%sql` magic command are immediately commited. This means that the log file has the transaction details and the results are committed to disk. In other words, you can't change your mind after the statement finishes execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is often referred to as `AUTOCOMMIT` and adds a level of overhead to statement execution because at the end of every statement the results must be \"hardened\". On the other hand, autocommit means you don't have to worry about explicitly committing work or causing potential locking issues because you are holding up resources. When a record is updated, no other user will be able to view it (unless using \"dirty read\") until you commit. Holding the resource in a lock means that other workloads may come to a halt while they wait for you to commit your work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a classic example of wanting a commit scope that is based on a series of statements:\n",
    "```\n",
    "withdrawal = 100\n",
    "%sql update checking set balance = balance - withdrawal\n",
    "%sql update savings set balance = balance + withdrawal\n",
    "```\n",
    "If autocommit is `ON`, you could have a problem with the transaction if the system failed after the first update statement. You would have taken money out of the checking account, but have not updated the savings account. To make sure that this transaction is run successfully:\n",
    "```\n",
    "%sql autocommit off\n",
    "withdrawal = 100\n",
    "%sql update checking set balance = balance - withdrawal\n",
    "%sql update savings set balance = balance + withdrawal\n",
    "%sql commit work\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the transaction fails before the `COMMIT WORK`, all changes to the database will be rolled back to its original state, thus protecting the integrity of the two tables."

By issuing a `COMMIT` you are releasing all of the resources and locks that your application may be holding.\n",
    "\n",
    "`COMMIT HOLD` will allow you to commit your work to disk, but keeps all of the resources open for further execution. This is useful for situations where you are inserting or updating 1000's of records and do not want to tie up log space waiting for a commit to occur. The following pseudocode gives you an example how this would be used:\n",
    "```\n",
    "%sql autocommit off\n",
    "for i = 1 to 1000\n",
    "    %sql insert into x values i\n",

    "## PREPARE and EXECUTE\n",
    "The `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` commands are useful in situations where you want to repeat an SQL statement multiple times while just changing the parameter values. There isn't any benefit from using these statements for simple tasks that may only run occassionally. The benefit of `PREPARE/EXECUTE` is more evident when dealing with a large number of transactions that are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PREPARE` statement can be used against many types of SQL, but in this implementation, only the following SQL statements are supported:\n",
    "* SELECT\n",
    "* INSERT\n",
    "* UPDATE\n",
    "* DELETE\n",
    "* MERGE\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare a statement, you must use the following syntax:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "stmt = %sql PREPARE sql ....\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PREPARE` statement always returns a statement handle. You must assign the results of the `PREPARE` statement to a variable since it will be required when you `EXECUTE` the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL statement must have any variables replaced with a question mark `?`. For instance, if you wanted to insert a single value into a table you would use the following syntax:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "stmt = %sql PREPARE insert into x values (?)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One important note with parameter markers. If you require the parameter to have a specific data type (say INTEGER) then you may want to place a `CAST` statement around it to force the proper conversion. Usually strings, integers, decimals, etc... convert fine when using this syntax, but occasionally you may run across a data type issue. For the previous example we could modify it to:\n",

    "\n",

    "### Using Arrays and Multiple Parameters\n",
    "When using the `PREPARE` statement, it can become cumbersome when dealing with many parameter markers. For instance, in order to insert 10 columns into a table the code would look similar to this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "stmt = %sql PREPARE INSERT INTO X VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "stmt = %sql PREPARE INSERT INTO X VALUES (?*10)\n",
    "```\n",
