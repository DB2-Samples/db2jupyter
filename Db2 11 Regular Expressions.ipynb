    "- **REGEXP_EXTRACT** - Returns one occurrence of a substring of a string that matches the regular expression pattern.\n",
    "- **REGEXP_INSTR** - Returns the starting or ending position of the matched substring, depending on the value of the return option argument.\n",
    "- **REGEXP_LIKE** - Returns a Boolean value indicating if the regular expression pattern is found in a string. The function can be used only where a predicate is supported.\n",
    "- **REGEXP_MATCH_COUNT** - Returns a count of the number of times that a regular expression pattern is matched in a string.\n",
    "- **REGEXP_REPLACE** - Returns a modified version of the source string where occurrences of the regular expression pattern found in the source string are replaced with the specified replacement string.\n",

If this flag is set, \"^\" and \"\\$\" also matches at the start and end of each line within the input string.\n",
    "|**n** | Specifies that the '.' character in a pattern matches a line terminator in the input string. By default, the '.' character in a pattern does not match a line terminator. A carriage-return and line-feed pair in the input string behaves as a single-line terminator, and matches a single \".\" in a pattern.\n",
