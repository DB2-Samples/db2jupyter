    "&#37;run db2.ipynb\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines a Jupyter/Python magic command called `%sql` which allows you to execute DB2 specific calls to \n",

    "designed for demonstrating a number of the SQL features available in DB2.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of executing the `%sql` command. A single line SQL statement would use the\n",

    "<pre>\n",
    "%sql SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "If you have a large block of sql then you would place the %%sql command at the beginning of the block and then\n",

    "## Development SQL\n",
    "The previous set of `%sql` and `%%sql` commands deals with SQL statements and commands that are run in an interactive manner. There is a class of SQL commands that are more suited to a development environment where code is iterated or requires changing input. The commands that are associated with this form of SQL are:\n",
    "- AUTOCOMMIT\n",
    "- COMMIT/ROLLBACK\n",
    "- PREPARE \n",
    "- EXECUTE\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocommit is the default manner in which SQL statements are executed. At the end of the successful completion of a statement, the results are commited to the database. There is no concept of a transaction where multiple DML/DDL statements are considered one transaction. The `AUTOCOMMIT` command allows you to turn autocommit `OFF` or `ON`. This means that the set of SQL commands run after the `AUTOCOMMIT OFF` command are executed are not commited to the database until a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` command is issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "`COMMIT` (`WORK`) will finalize all of the transactions (`COMMIT`) to the database and `ROLLBACK` will undo all of the changes. If you issue a `SELECT` statement during the execution of your block, the results will reflect all of your changes. If you `ROLLBACK` the transaction, the changes will be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PREPARE` is typically used in a situation where you want to repeatidly execute a SQL statement with different variables without incurring the SQL compilation overhead. For instance:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = %sql PREPARE SELECT LASTNAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EMPNO=?\n",
    "for y in ['000010','000020','000030']:\n",
    "    %sql execute :x using :y\n",
    "```\n",
    "`EXECUTE` is used to execute a previously compiled statement. \n",

    "\n",
    "* SQLCODE\n",

    "This routine takes as an argument a string and then splits the arguments according to the following logic:\n",
    "* If the string starts with a `(` character, it will check the last character in the string and see if it is a `)` and then remove those characters\n",
    "* Every parameter is separated by a comma `,` and commas within quotes are ignored\n",
    "* Each parameter returned will have three values returned - one for the value itself, an indicator which will be either True if it was quoted, or False if not, and True or False if it is numeric.\n",

    "```\n",

    "Any quoted string will be False for numeric. The way that the parameters are handled are up to the calling program. However, in the case of Db2, the quoted strings must be in single quotes so any quoted parameter using the double quotes `\"` must be wrapped with single quotes. There is always a possibility that a string contains single quotes (i.e. O'Connor) so any substituted text should use `''` so that Db2 can properly interpret the string. This routine does not adjust the strings with quotes, and depends on the variable subtitution routine to do that. "
