    "## Development SQL\n",
    "The previous set of `%sql` and `%%sql` commands deals with SQL statements and commands that are run in an interactive manner. There is a class of SQL commands that are more suited to a development environment where code is iterated or requires changing input. The commands that are associated with this form of SQL are:\n",
    "- AUTOCOMMIT\n",
    "- COMMIT/ROLLBACK\n",
    "- PREPARE \n",
    "- EXECUTE\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocommit is the default manner in which SQL statements are executed. At the end of the successful completion of a statement, the results are commited to the database. There is no concept of a transaction where multiple DML/DDL statements are considered one transaction. The `AUTOCOMMIT` command allows you to turn autocommit `OFF` or `ON`. This means that the set of SQL commands run after the `AUTOCOMMIT OFF` command are executed are not commited to the database until a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` command is issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "`COMMIT` (`WORK`) will finalize all of the transactions (`COMMIT`) to the database and `ROLLBACK` will undo all of the changes. If you issue a `SELECT` statement during the execution of your block, the results will reflect all of your changes. If you `ROLLBACK` the transaction, the changes will be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PREPARE` is typically used in a situation where you want to repeatidly execute a SQL statement with different variables without incurring the SQL compilation overhead. For instance:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = %sql PREPARE SELECT LASTNAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EMPNO=?\n",
    "for y in ['000010','000020','000030']:\n",

If the answer set is larger than this amount, only the first 5 rows and last 5 rows of the answer set will be displayed.

If you really want to show all results then setting MAXROWS to -1 will return all output.\n",

You can set this to a larger size so that more rows are shown on the screen. Note that the minimum size always remains at 5 which means that if the system is unable to display your maximum row size it will reduce the table display until it fits.\n",

There is always a possibility that a string contains single quotes (i.e. O'Connor) so any substituted text should use `''` so that Db2 can properly interpret the string.
