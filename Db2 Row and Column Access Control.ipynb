    "Row permissions and column masks are two new database concepts introduced in DB2 10 that address the shortcomings of traditional security methods. These new features act as a second layer of security that complements the table privileges security model available in prior releases of DB2.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of row permissions and column masks is that no database user is automatically exempted from them — not even users with the DATAACCESS authority. The ability to manage row permissions and column masks within a database is vested solely in a user with SECADM, thereby ensuring that users with DATAACCESS authority can no longer freely access all data in the database.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Another key advantage is that row permissions and column masks ensure that table data is protected regardless of how the SQL accesses the table, be it through an application, through ad hoc query tools, or through report generation tools.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Finally, and perhaps most significantly, row permissions and column masks require no application changes; RCAC is transparent to existing applications."
