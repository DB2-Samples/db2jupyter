    "As you can see from the previous examples, it is possible to analytics against the JSON data. However, it requires some sophisticated techniques for manipulating (and converting) the JSON data. One approach is to use the JSON functions and move the data into a traditional relational table for analysis. The following SQL will create a \"flat\" relational table that will allow for further analysis without having to do joins. In addition, we are going to create the table using column organization which will give us the ability to do queries without having to worry about what indexes are needed. "
